    -  Maximum time you can stay at a depth and ascend without having to stop
  
  36. Why should you avoid the maximum limits of dive tables and dive computers?
    - Models can't account for individual variations, people differ in their susceptibility to decompression sickness

  37. How does the Recreational Dive Planners distributed by PADI differ from other dive tables?
    - They are the only tables designed and tested specifically for recreational no-stop diving

  38. Why is your body nitrogen level higher after a repetitive dive than if you made the same dive as a nonrepetitive dive?
    - It has nitrogen left from dive 1 plus anything you gained from dive 2

  39. What is residual nitrogen?
    - Excess nitrogen left in your body after the dive

  40. What is a repetitive dive?
    - Any dive made while you still have nitrogen in your system

  41. What are the general rules for using the Recreational Dive Planner and how do you apply them?
    - Any dive 10m/35ft or less = 10m/35ft
    - Use the exact or next greater depth shown for the depths of all dives
    - Use the exact or next greater time shown for the times of all dives
    - Slowly ascend from all dives at a rate that doesn't exceed 18m/60ft per minute
    - Always be conservative and avoid using the maximum limits provided
    - Plan dive is 4m/10ft deeper than actual when cold or strenious
    - Plan repetitive dices so each successful dive is to a shallower depth
    - Limit all repetitive dives to 30m/100ft or shallower
    - Limit your max depth to your training and experience
      - OWD 18m/60ft
