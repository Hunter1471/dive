  27. What should you do if you get caught in a rip current?
    - Establish buoyancy and swim parallel to shore until clear of the area
    - Never swim directly against a rip current

  28. What causes and upwelling, and how might it affect local offshore dive conditions?
    - Slow moving current caused by offshore winds pushing surface water away from shore
    - Deep water flows up to take its place
