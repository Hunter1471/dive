# Section Five

### Safety Stops
  1. What are the recommended depth and time intervals for a safety stop?
    - 3-6m 10-20feet for 3 minutes or longer

  2. What's the purpose of a safety stop?
    - Provide time for your body to eliminate nitrogen
    - Help stabilize and control your ascent rate before continuing to surface

  3. What are three situations in which they are considered required?
    - 30m/100f or deeper
    - If your RDP is within three pressure groups of the no-stop limit
    - You reach any limit on your dive computer or RDP

### Emergency Decompression
  4. What should you do if you exceed a no decompression limit or an adjusted no decompression limit by five minutes or less when using the RDP?
    - Ascend no faster than 18m/60ft per minute to 5/m/15ft and remain there for eight min
    - Do not dive for at least six hours afterwards

  5. What should you do if you exceed a no decompression limit or an adjusted no decompression limit by more than five minutes when using the RDP?
    - A 5m/15ft stop for no less than 15min is strongly urged
    - Upon surfacing remain out of the water for at least 24 hours before diving
    - Breathe pure oxygen if its available

  6. How do you determine emergency decompression requirements with a dive computer?
    - Computer will show stop depth, time required and when you may surface
    - Read each computer's literature for more details

### Altitude Diving, Flying After Diving and Cold/Strenious Dives
  7. Above what altitude do you need to use special dive proceedures?
    - 300m/1000ft

  8. What are the recommendations for flying in a commercial airliner after diving?
    - Single Dives - wait 12 hours
    - Repetitive Dives/ Multi-Day Dives - 18 hours
    - Dives requiring decompression stops - 18 hours

  9. What are the procedures for planning a dive in cold water or under strenious dives?
    - Dive as if it was 4m/10ft deeper than it really is

### Using a Dive Computer
  10. What procedures and general recommendations apply to diving with a computer?
    - Remember they are no more less valid than dive tables
    - Don't share your computer
    - Follow the most conservative computer
    - Don't turn your computer off between dives
    - Make deepest dives first and progressively shallower on next dives
    - Stay within your computer limits
    - If your computer quits stop diving for 12-24 hours
    - If it quits during a dive ascend to 5m/15ft for 5min to be safe
    - Take RDP with you

### Basic Compass Navigation
  11. What are the 4 basic features of an underwater compass?
    - Lubber line - indicates your travel direction
    - Magnetic North Needle - points to magnetic north
    - Bezel - rotated to provide two small parallel index marks to help you maintain straight line
    - Heading references - record your direction of travel as measured in degree from magnetic north

  12. What is the proper hand and arm position when using a compass mounted on the wrist?
    - Other arm straight out and then with compass arm hold your outstretched elbow

  13. What is the proper method of holding a compass when it is mounted in an instrument console?
    - Squarely in front with both hands

  14. How do you set an underwater compass to navigate a straight line from a beginning location to a predetermined destination?
    - Point lubber line in the direction you want to go
    - Align your body with the lubber line
    - Hold the compass level and allow needle to settle
    - Turn bezel so index marks align over needle
    - Swim keeping compass level and needle within index marks

  15. How do you set an underwater compass for a reciprocal heading?
    - Rotate the bezel so index marks are opposite of original location
    - Turn until compass needle sits inside index marks
    - Swim along lubber line keeping needle within marks

### Continuing Your Adventure
  16. What is the purpose of the PADI System of Diver Education
    - To provide to meet people, go places and do things underwater

  17. What are 3 benefits of continuing your diver education beyond PADI OW Diver
    - Introduces you to specialized dive activities
    - Get your acquainted with different conditions
    - Way to gain experience on a variety of aquatic environments

  18. What dive adventure do you want next?
    - Underwater Navigation Dive + Deep Dive + 3 Adventure Dives = Advanced Open Water Diver
  
### Using the Recreational Dive Planner
  19. How do you find the minimum surface interval required to complete a series of no decompression dives using the RDP?
    -
