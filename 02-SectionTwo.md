# Section Two

## Adapting to the Underwater World
###
  1. How does looking at something underwater affect its apparent size?
    - Refraction magnifies everything about 33%
  2. How does water affect light intensity and color?
    - Darker and obsorbes color
    - You loose Red, then Orange, Yellow, Green and Blue deeper you go.
  3. How des being underwater affect hearing?
    - Sound travels 4x faster underwater
    - Oftentimes things sounds like they are coming from above
    - Knock on tank to alert your budy
### Heat Loss Underwater
  4. How does rate of body leat loss compare to rate of body heat loss in air?
    - Water conducts heat 20x faster than air
    - Wetsuits slow but don't stop heat loss
  5. What should you do if you begin to shiver continuously underwater?
    - Get out of the water immediately

### Motion in Water
  6. How should you move underwater to compensate for increased resistance of water?
    - Slow and Steadily
    - Level and streamlined = less drag and more efficiant
    - Avoid rapid anything, relax and save energy

## Respiration

    - Tendency to Panic

  9. How to prevent diving overexertion
    - Know physcial limits and pace yourself
    - Avoid prolonged heavy exertion

  10. What should you do if you become overexerted while diving?
    - Stop all activity, rest and catch your breath
    - Hold onto something and relax
    - Establish buoyancy with BCD
    - Proceed slower

### Airway control and breathing goals
  11. What are three tecniques used for airway control?
    - Inhale slowly if water enters
    - Inhale cautiously and slowly after clearing
    - Use your tongue as a spash guard

## Dive Equipment
### Exposure Suits (Body, Wet, Dry Suits)
  12. Two reasons for wearing an expsure suit while diving?
    - Reduce Heat Loss
    - Protect you from minor scrapes, stings and abrasions.

  13. How do wet/dry suits insulate divers?
    - Reduce heat loss through insulating neoprene foam
    - Traps the water and heats the water inside via your body heat
    - Drysuits fit loose heat air and trap it inside, equalized via BCD

  14. Why must a wet suit fit snugly?
    - If water moves in and out of the wetsuit your body doesn't have time to heat it

  15. What two properties may an exposure suit loose due to depth and water pressure?
    - Bouyancy and Insulation

  16. What three factors should you consider when selecting a exposure suit?
    - Thermal Protection
    - Comfort
    - Fit

  17. Four procedures for caring for an exposure suit?
    - Rinse
    - Dry inside out
    - Store (Wet suit - Wide Hanger, Dry suit - Folded with zipper on top)
    - Lubricate dry suit zippers

### Exposure Suit Accessories
  18. Why do you need a hood and what are three basic types?
    - 75% heat loss comes from your head. Cold Water keeps this in.
    - Bibbed, Non-Bibbed, Hooded Vest

  19. Why should you avoid and excessively tight hood?
    - Too tight compresses arteries in neck which your body precieves as high-bloodpressure and adjusts
    - Can cause lightheadedness and fainting

  20. What are two reasons for wearing dive gloves?
    - Do not have natural insulation
    - Hands soften and become more vulnerable to scrapes and cuts

  21. What are three reasons for wearing wet suit boots?
    - Warmth
    - Protection
    - Comfort

### Overheating
  22. In what 6 ways can you prevent overheating before a dive when wearing an exposure suit?
    - Put suit on last
    - Limit activity with suit on
    - Stay out of sun
    - Keep hood off or pulled back
    - Leave unzipped
    - Cool off in water / hose
    - Hydrate often (in general)

### Weight Systems
  23. 2 Types of weight systems are?
    - Weight Belt
    - Integrated Weight Systems

  24. Most important feature of any weight system?
    - Quick release

  25. How do you determine how much weight you need for a dive?
    - (more weight in cooler water)
    - Enter water with all gear on
    - With Regulator in, deflate BCD and hold normal breath
    - Adjust weight until you float at eye level
    - Exhale and you should decend
    - If using full cylindar add 2kg/5lbs

### Alternative Air Sources
  26. What is an alternate air source?
    - Any second stage you may use other than your own primary stage

  27. What two types of Alternative Air Sources require the help of another diver?
    - Alternate Second Stage (Octopus)
    - Alternate Inflator Regulator

  28. What does not require another diver?
    - Poney Bottle
    - Self contained ascent bottle

  29. Why it is important to specially mark an extra second stage used as an alternate air source?
    - Easy identification incase of an emergency  

  30. How and where should you attach your alternate air source?
    - Secure in triangle formed by chin and lower rib cage
  
### Low Pressure Inflator
  31. Why do you need a low pressure inflator?
    - Inflate your BCD with one hand

### Dive Knives
  32. Why do you need a dive knife or tool?
    - So you have a tool for safety and convenience

  33. What three features should you consider when selecting?

    - Your time limit is based on depth

  39. What is the purpose of a dive computer?
    - Combines depth gauge, timer and SPG in one unit
    - More convenient and precise - more dive time

  40. What are three reasons you need an underwater compass?
    - Follow a course
    - Find your way to exit
