1. Whether an object sinks, floats or does neither depends on its weight displacment.
2. You'll use lead weight and a BCS, as well as lung volume to control your bouyncy.
3. The body is made up of mostly incompressible liquid, so you only feel pressure on the air spaces, which hold compressible air.
4. There's a proportional relationship between pressure, air volume and density.
5. You can use one of the three techniques every meter/few feet to equalize your ears to prevent a squeeze while descending
6. You exhale into your mask through your nose to prevent a squeeze.
7. Never continue to descend if you can't equalize.
8. The most important rule in scuba diving is to never hold your breath.
9. Don't dive with a cold or allergy congestion, even with decongestant.
10. The deeper you go, the faster you use up your air supply.
