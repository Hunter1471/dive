### Buoyancy
  1. What will buoyancy of an object be (postitive, neutral or negative) if it displaces an amount of water:
    - more than its own weight? = positively buoyant
    - less than its own weight? = negatively buoyant
    - equal to its own weight? = neutrally buoyant
  
  2. Why is buoyancy control, both at the surface and underwater, one of the most important skills a diver can master?
    - Float positively when you need to rest/save energy
    - Neutral buoyancy lets you swim effortlessly

  3. What two items control a divers buoyancy?
    - BCD
    - Weight System

  4. How does the buoyancy of an object differ in fresh water compared to salt water?
    - Salt Water weighs more, so you will be more buoyant in salt water

  5. How does lung volume affect buoyancy?
    - Inhale = more buoyant
    - Exhale = less buoyant
