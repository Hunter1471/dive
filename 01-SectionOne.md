## The Underwater World
### Buoyancy
  1. What will buoyancy of an object be (postitive, neutral or negative) if it displaces an amount of water:
    - more than its own weight? = positively buoyant
    - less than its own weight? = negatively buoyant
    - equal to its own weight? = neutrally buoyant
  
  2. Why is buoyancy control, both at the surface and underwater, one of the most important skills a diver can master?
    - You can control where you are at in the water
      - Float positively when you need to rest/save energy
      - Neutral buoyancy lets you swim effortlessly

  3. What two items control a divers buoyancy?
    - BCD
    - Weight System

  4. How does the buoyancy of an object differ in fresh water compared to salt water?
    - Salt Water weighs more, so you will be more buoyant in salt water

  5. How does lung volume affect buoyancy?
    - Inhale = more buoyant
    - Exhale = less buoyant

### Pressure and Your Body
  6. You feel pressure changes only in body air spaces because
    - Your body is made up of mostly liquid, but air is compressible and changes volume with presure changes
  7. Why are pressure changes while ascending or descending underwater much more substantial than pressure changes when ascending or decending in the same distance in air?

### Pressure, Volume and Density Relationships

  8. What is the relationship between increasing and decreasing depth and water pressure?

  9. What are the absolute pressures in atmosphere or bar for:
    - 0m/0' = 1bar/ata
    - 10m/33' = 2bar/ata = 1/2 air vol = 2x Air Density
    - 20m/66' = 3bar/ata = 1/3 air vol = 3x Air Density
    - 30m/99' = 4bar/ata = 1/4 air vol = 4x Air Density
    - 40m/132' = 5bar/ata
  10. What is the relationship between air volume and density, and how do they vary according to this relationship when pressure increases or decreases?
  
### The Effects of Increasing Pressure

  11. What are the three major air spaces affected by pressure?
    - Ears (natural)
    - Sinuses (natural)
    - Mask (artificial)
  12. What is a "squeeze"?
    - pressure outside your air space is greater than pressure inside causing pain when you descend

  13. What is "equalization"?
    - Adding air to the airspace as you descend keeping the air space equal to the water pressure. IE hold your nose and blow.

  14. What are three ways you can equalize air during descent?
    - Pinch nose and blow
    - Swallow and wiggle jaw
    - Exhale into your mask

  15. How often should you equalize during descent?
    - Early and often before discomfort

  16. What three steps should you take if you feel discomfort in air space while descending?
    - Equalize
    - Ascend a few meters/feet try to equalize
    - Ascend and try again another day

### The Effects of Decreasing Pressure

  17. What is the most important rule of scuba diving?
    - Do not hold your breath, breathe continuously.

  18. What are the consequences of breaking the most important rule?
    - Lung over pressurization
    - Paralysis
    - Death

  19. What is a "reverse block"?
    - pressure when expanding air cannot escape during an ascent
    - possible in stomach (swollowing air, gassy foods), teeth (filling errors), etc.
  20. What should you do if you feel discomfort during ascent due to air expansion in the ears, sinuses, stomach intestines or teeth?
    - Slow or stop your ascent
    - Descend a meter or few feet
    - Give air time to work its way out
    - Resume at slower rate

### The Effects of Increased Air Density

  21. How does increasing depth affect how long your air supply lasts?
    - Deeper you dive = Faster air used
    - Air 20m = 3bar = 1/3 density = 1/3 air
  22. What's the most efficient way to breath dense air under water?
    - Slow, deep, relaxed breathing.

## Dive Equipment
### Masks

    - Keep out of sun
    - Cool Dry Place

### Snorkles
  29. Why does a diver need a snorkel?
    - Less tiring to swim with face in water
    - Easier to breathe in rough surface conditions

  30. What three features does an easy-breathing snorkel have?
    - Large Bore (breathing)
    - Not too long
